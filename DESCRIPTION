Description: Honest and nearly-optimal confidence intervals in fuzzy and sharp
    regression discontinuity designs and for inference at a point based on local
    linear regression. The implementation is based on Armstrong and Kolesár (2018)
    <doi:10.3982/ECTA14434>, and Kolesár and Rothe (2018)
    <doi:10.1257/aer.20160945>. Supports covariates, clustering, and weighting.
